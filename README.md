# Rails-API-App

## How Create EVERY Rails API App

## 1. Generate the project.
[List of all available options](https://www.bootrails.com/blog/rails-new-options/)

```sh
rails new my_app --database=postgresql --api --skip-git
```

## 2. RSpec

To ensure these instructions are up to date, if anything goes wrong please [reference the official documentation](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails).

Add the following to the Gemfile:

```ruby
group :development, :test do
  gem 'rspec-rails', '~> 6.0.0'
end
```

Next run the following commands:

```sh
$ rails generate rspec:install
$ bundle binstubs rspec-core
```

## 3. Other Gems

[Pry](https://github.com/pry/pry)  is a runtime developer console and IRB alternative with powerful introspection capabilities. Pry aims to be more than an IRB replacement. It is an attempt to bring REPL driven programming to the Ruby language.

```ruby
gem 'pry', '~> 0.13.1'
```


[Pry-rails](https://github.com/pry/pry-rails). 
Avoid repeating yourself, use pry-rails instead of copying the initializer to every rails project. This is a small gem which causes rails console to open pry. It therefore depends on pry.

```ruby
gem 'pry-rails', :group => :development
```


The [ActiveRecord Import ](https://rubygems.org/gems/activerecord-import/versions/0.15.0) gem provides an alternative approach that allows you to import large amounts of data into your database using a single SQL INSERT statement. This can greatly speed up the import process and reduce the memory usage of your application.

```ruby
gem 'activerecord-import', '~> 0.15.0'
```


[Figaro](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro) was written to make it easy to securely configure Rails applications.
Configuration values often include sensitive information. Figaro strives to be secure by default by encouraging a convention that keeps configuration out of Git.

```ruby
gem "figaro"
```

```sh
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec figaro install
```
Create a new file ```config/application.yml``` for your environment configuration.



[Bullet](https://github.com/flyerhzm/bullet) gem is designed to help you increase your application's performance by reducing the number of queries it makes. It will watch your queries while you develop your application and notify you when you should add eager loading (N+1 queries), when you're using eager loading that isn't necessary and when you should use counter cache.

```ruby
gem 'bullet', group: 'development'
```

```sh
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rails g bullet:install
```

Bullet won't enable any notification systems unless you tell it to explicitly. Append to ```config/environments/development.rb``` initializer with the following code:

```ruby
config.after_initialize do
  Bullet.enable = true
  Bullet.sentry = true
  Bullet.alert = true
  Bullet.bullet_logger = true
  Bullet.console = true
  Bullet.rails_logger = true
end
```


[Annotate](https://makingsenseofrails.dev/how-to-use-the-annotate-gem-c44bfec97d03) gem will add a comment to the top of selected files (models, fixtures, specs) describing the database schema relevant to those files â€” including field names, index configuration, and foreign keys. It will update these comments automatically whenever you run rails db:migrate.

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'annotate'
end
```

```sh
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rails g annotate:install
```
This will generate a rake task in lib/tasks/auto_annotate_models.rake with the default configuration.
